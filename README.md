# Overhaul-Mod
Some ROR2 skill changes

This Requires Bepinex*

To install this go to your steam folder, find Risk of rain 2 and install in Bepinex plugin folder and move the Overhaul.dll into plugins

Currently what this mod does is changes Huntress' fourth ability to allow her to be able to hit mobs in the sky by changing her ultimate into a short 5 second buff that makes her first ability able to shoot 3 projectiles at once. Each projectile do seperate damage calculations meaning that they all proc crits and item procs individually. Compared to her ultimate, this is weaker early own against ground enemies but much better against flying enemies and eventually outshines her old ultimate the more items you have.

This mod will be added onto and later alter other skills
